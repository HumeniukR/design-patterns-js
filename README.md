# Design Patterns JS
Ğ¡heat sheet on programming patterns using the JavaScript language (annual goal assignment task)

The goal of the project is to create a set of examples of design patterns with a possible greater variety of approaches and stylistics in order to refer to this repo later and get ideas for work or play around with these examples later to refresh the knowledge.

### Classification

**Creational patterns** they rely on the creation of objects without introducing any dependencies into the program.. [->](https://github.com/HumeniukR/design-patterns-js/tree/master/creational-patterns)

**Structural patterns** show different ways of creating connections between objects.  [->](https://github.com/HumeniukR/design-patterns-js/tree/master/structural-patterns)

**Behavioral patterns** focus on effective communication between objects. [->](https://github.com/HumeniukR/design-patterns-js/tree/master/behavioral-patterns)

**Other patterns** unclassified techniques for accomplishing specific tasks. [->](https://github.com/HumeniukR/design-patterns-js/tree/master/other-patterns)


_One js file - one pattern, one folder - one class of patterns_
